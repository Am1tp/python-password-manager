# python-password-manager

A password manager which locally saves the details of website + email adddress + password entered by the user to a txt file.

The local txt file is created using the name 'Saved_Logins' if the file does not exist, otherwise any new logins will be appended on a new line.

The app can generate a random password consisting of letters, numbers and symbols if the user chooses not to enter their own password, the password is then made ready for use by copying it to user clipboard.

Made using Tkinter, Random, Os and Pyperclip.
